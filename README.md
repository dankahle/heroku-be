#### A common backend for all projects

I get one free node app from heroku and one free database from mongolab. The deal is to *share* these between all projects. There's only one heroku port, so can't run a server for each project, so all server code will be shared and the package.json node modules a union of all aggregated projects. This could be limiting under web application scenarios, but when simply presenting a rest api, shouldn't be an issue.

Each project will have a project router that handles "/projectName" route, and specific routers inside that for its own needs. Only thing that affects the server code is the app.use('/projectName', projectRouter) line. Everything else is encapsulated in the specific project files.

Each project creates its own connections to mongodb. The mongo collections are namespaced by project name, to help separate them from each other. There may be a limit to how many concurrent connections are allowed to mongo, if so, I may need to find a way to share between projects. 

The other side of the coin are the frontends. They will run as static websites under github.io gh-pages branches. This affords free frontend serving as well :). The front and backend projects will run independently locally, then be ported to gh-pages/heroku-be when complete for public consumption.

#### Proof of concept
I use 2 frontend projects: heroku1-fe, heroku2-fe
and 2 backend projects: heroku1-be, heroku2-be to prove the concept. The frontends have a gulpfile that produces a dist directory which I orphan branch into gh-pages. For the backends, I simply grab their src directories sans index.js and place it into the heroku-be project then redeploy to heroku.
